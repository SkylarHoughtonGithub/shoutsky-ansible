### DOCUMENTATION
#
# title: Create an ssh config file for a list of hosts
#
# description: |-
#   This task has two params for the template task below
#     - config_path      optional       default: '~/.ssh/config'
#     - file_mode        optional       default: '0644'
#
#   and two passthrough params for the template itself
#     - ssh_hosts        required       list of hosts
#     - ssh_keytype      optional       default: 'rsa'
#     - keypair_path     optional       default: '~/.ssh/id_' + ssh_keytype
#     - include_paths    optional       default: empty list
#
#   The hosts are used as hostvars keys meeting the following expectations:
#
#   hostvars[host].ansible_host must be defined.
#
#   A stanza will be added to the ssh config pairing each host with the
#   corresponding ansible_host
#
#   hostvars[host].ssh_connection_address may be defined
#   hostvars[host].ssh_hostname may be defined
#
#   A stanza will be added to the ssh config pairing each ansible_host with either of
#   these, in the order listed. If neither is defined then the pairing will be omitted.
#
