Proxmox Init
=========

base setup of proxmox host for stylistic choices

Requirements
------------

- install sudo
- setup ansible user with keypair for ssh access

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - role: proxmox_init
